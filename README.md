## Instructions
Go to the Ghandi Statue in downtown Bellevue.  Press the play button.  Run back and forth between the Ghandi Statue and Double Inquiry art as many times as you can in 5 minutes.  Then try to beat your high score.  Make sure to point your phone's camera at the Ghandi Statue or Double Inquiry art for your score to increment.

## Challenges
I do not have a test device with cell service, so I have not been able to test the code or create a video of the gameplay.

## Functionality
In theory, it should all work.  But it is untested.

## Code Quality
Code quality should be fine.  It was a first pass, so there is room for improvement.  But for such a small project, it is sufficient.

## Creativity
0 points :)

## User Experience
Aside from a play button, there is no tutorial or guidance on how to play the game.  The user experience is pretty terrible.

## Learning and Adaptation
There were no issues incorporating Lightship ARDK.
